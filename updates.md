today I was trying to create a function that created a list from an input number
now i have a new problem how do I get the multiple variables from the entry 
I also need to find a way to input the value into the time and distance list.

![code worked on here](worktime.png)
shown here I used a function that I had to ask an AI to help me out with however I had to come up with a way to convert the from a tkinter entry then a button press.
